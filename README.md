# dejalu

Fast and Simple Email Client.

[You can download it on the website.](https://dejalu.me)

# Dependencies

```
$ npm install -g uglify-js
$ npm install -g clean-css-cli
```

# API keys

To get the application entirely working, you would need to get some keys.

- Google API Key for Gmail accounts & Google Analytics identifier
- Microsoft API Key (for Outlook connectivity)
- HockeyApp API Key for crash reports
- GIPHY API Key for GIF support

Some parts of the app won't be working if you don't have them.
